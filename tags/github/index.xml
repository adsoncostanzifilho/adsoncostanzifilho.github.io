      <description>Motivation Recently I was introduced by some friends to the GitHub Actions and how it could help me execute tasks like: deploy my Shiny Apps, deploy this Blogdown, perform automated tests in packages, refresh data, and more. So, I decided to give it a try, and it was so simple and saved me so many work hours that I decided to write this post explaining how R developers can make good use of this amazing tool.</description>
