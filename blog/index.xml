      <description>Overview  
SoothsayeR is an interface based on the old prank called ‘Peter answers’..
The game’s idea is to play with your friends making questions that you know the answer, and make them believe that R is who is answering…
The app demonstrates how easy it is to integrate Shiny with Javascript through the shinyjs library.
The tool is online on shinyapps’ repository at the address https://adsoncostanzi.shinyapps.io/soothsayeR/.</description>
