      <description>Overview  
The CSGo package is an R client for accessing Steam’s REST API specifically for the Counter-Strike Global Offensive Game (CS Go) data. Check out the Steam documentation website for more information.
 Installation To get the current released version from CRAN:
install.packages(&amp;quot;CSGo&amp;quot;) To get the current development version from GitHub:
# install.packages(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;) devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;adsoncostanzifilho/CSGo&amp;quot;)  Example The first step to use the CSGo package is to have your own credentials (API key) to pull the CSGo data from the Steam API.</description>

      <description>Motivation  If you are using a script more than 3 times it is time to create a function and if you are using a function in 3 different projects it is time to create a package. “I heard it from someone, but I don’t remember who..”
 Recently I experienced the whole flow to create a new R package with the help of amazing packages like devtools, usethis, pkgdown, and roxygen2.</description>

      <title>Blogdown Tutorial</title>

      <description>Motivation I had the idea of writing some “walking through” about blogdown, first because it was my first time using the package and I still have all the necessary steps fresh in my mind and second because probably I will need to have it all documented if I decided to refresh this blog one day. Of course, there are a lot of great tutorials about blogdown over the internet (the blogdown book for example), but maybe someone could find this one easier in some way…</description>

      <description>Overview  
SoothsayeR is an interface based on the old prank called ‘Peter answers’..
The game’s idea is to play with your friends making questions that you know the answer, and make them believe that R is who is answering…
The app demonstrates how easy it is to integrate Shiny with Javascript through the shinyjs library.
The tool is online on shinyapps’ repository at the address https://adsoncostanzi.shinyapps.io/soothsayeR/.</description>
